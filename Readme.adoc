This is an example of Performane Indicator Implemented in python.
It is prepared to be used within the Eurobench Benchmarking Software.

Requires the following packages (install with `apt-get`): `python3`, `python3-venv` .

And then run the following commands:

[source, shell]
----
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r src/pi_sample_duration/requirements.txt
python src/pi_sample_duration/setup.py develop
----

Last line should be verified although...

== Launch the program

[source, shell]
----
./run_pi test_data/input/data_in.csv out_folder
----

We assume `out_folder` exists.

== Docker management

=== Docker image generation

Run the following command in order to create the docker image for this PI:

[source, shell]
----
docker build . -t pi_sample_duration
----

=== Launch the docker image

Assuming the folder `test_data/input/` contains the input data, and that the directory `out_folder/` is created, and will contain the PI output:

[source, shell]
----
docker run --rm -v $PWD/test_data/input:/in -v $PWD/out_folder:/out pi_sample_duration ./run_pi /in/data_in.csv /out
----
